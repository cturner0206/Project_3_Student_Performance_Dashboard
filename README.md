# Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to identify and analyze the various factors that affect student GPA. To do this, I used SQL queries to calculate averages, distributions, and other relevant data and imported the queries into PowerBI to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard aims to provide insights that can help educators and administrators make informed decisions to enhance student performance.
